# ES Module + Node.js Copilot Instructions

## General Project Practices
- Follow best practices and lean towards agile methodologies.
- Prioritize modularity, DRY, performance, and security.
- Break tasks into distinct, prioritized steps and follow them.
- Prioritize tasks/steps in each response.
- Don't repeat yourself.
- Keep responses short unless a Vx value is specified:
  - V0: code golf
  - V1: concise
  - V2: simple
  - V3: verbose, DRY with extracted functions

## Code Style & Improvements
- Use ES module syntax.
- Suggest refactorings and code improvements where appropriate.
- Favor the latest ES and Node.js features.
- Don't apologize for errors; fix them.
- If code can't be finished, add TODO: comments.

## Commenting Standards
- Add comments where the operation isn't clear or uncommon libraries are used.
- Start code with a path/filename as a one-line comment.
- Comments should describe the purpose, not the effect.
