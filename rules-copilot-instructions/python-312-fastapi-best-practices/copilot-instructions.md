## Best Practices
1. Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
2. Follow PEP 8 for code formatting.
3. Document functions and classes with docstrings.
4. Write simple, clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
5. Prefer list comprehensions over traditional loops when appropriate.
6. Use try-except blocks for graceful exception handling.
7. Isolate dependencies with virtual environments (e.g., venv).
8. Write unit tests for code reliability.
9. Use type hints for clarity and type checking.
10. Avoid global variables to reduce side effects.

These rules help ensure clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code.
