# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Code Writing Standards
- Follow established code-writing standards for your language (spacing, comments, naming).
- Consider internal coding rules for folder and function naming.

## Comment Usage
- Use comments sparingly and make them meaningful.
- Avoid commenting on obvious things; use comments to explain "why" or unusual behavior.

## Conditional Encapsulation
- Encapsulate nested if/else statements into functions with descriptive names for clarity.

## DRY Principle
- Avoid code duplication; reuse code via functions, classes, modules, or libraries.
- Modify code in one place if updates are needed.

## Function Length & Responsibility
- Write short, focused functions (single responsibility principle).
- Break up long or complex functions into smaller ones.

## General Code Style & Readability
- Write readable, understandable, and maintainable code.
- Prioritize clarity and adhere to coding standards.
- Regularly review and refactor code for structure and maintainability.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for collaboration.

## Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Names should reflect purpose and behavior; avoid names that require comments to explain intent.
