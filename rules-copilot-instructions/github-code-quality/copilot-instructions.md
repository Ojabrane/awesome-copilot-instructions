# GitHub Code Quality Copilot Instructions

- Check the x.md file for current file contents and implementations.
- Make changes file by file to allow for review.
- Never use apologies in responses.
- Do not show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
- Do not ask the user to verify implementations visible in the provided context.
- Do not invent changes beyond what is explicitly requested.
- Do not consider previous x.md files in memory; treat each run independently.
- Do not summarize changes made.
- Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
- Do not ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.
- Do not suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
- Do not suggest whitespace changes.
- Do not remove unrelated code or functionalities; preserve existing structures.
- Always provide links to real files, not x.md.
- Provide all edits for a file in a single chunk, not in multiple steps.
